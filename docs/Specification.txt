User story:

A web app that runs and brings up a single-page application (SPA). Users can manage pages and create, delete, or edit pages based on their permissions. On the pages, users can use some prepared UI components which have style and logic. Their style depends on the main theme. Each component has its logic. Users can create a pre-created page or a pre-created UI component and configure their logic. All the components will be saved, and each time the user can manage the website content. Ultimately, the user generates its website and the output is some linked pages with logic.
