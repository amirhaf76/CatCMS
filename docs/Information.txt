A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates like a website.

The following are common functions of a CMS:

Content creation allows users to easily create and format content

Content storage stores content in one place, in a consistent fashion

Workflows assigns permissions for managing content based on roles such as authors, editors and admins

Publishing tells the software when and where the content should go live

Optimization helps you improve digital experience and learn from your content

TL;DR a website is a collection of web pages you can browse and a CMS is the software that the website runs on.

Wikipedia probably describes it best—“a website is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.“
In contrast, a CMS or Content Management System, is a piece of software that allows you to store, manage and publish said web pages.
